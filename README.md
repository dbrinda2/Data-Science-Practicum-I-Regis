An Analysis of NFL Injuries by Drew Brinda for the Data Science Practicum I at Regis. 

#Goal
The problem I am trying to assess is examining the effects that playing on synthetic turf versus natural turf can have on player movements and the factors that may contribute to lower extremity injuries. I will be comparing different factors like part of the body that was injured, number of days out with injury, roster position of injured player, stadium type, temperature, and weather.
