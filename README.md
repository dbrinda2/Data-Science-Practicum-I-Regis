# Data-Science-Practicum-I-Regis
An Analysis of NFL Injuries by Drew Brinda for the Data Science Practicum I at Regis. 

## Goal
The problem I am trying to assess is examining the effects that playing on synthetic turf versus natural turf can have on player movements and the factors that may contribute to lower extremity injuries. I will be comparing different factors like part of the body that was injured, number of days out with injury, roster position of injured player, stadium type, temperature, and weather. 

## Datasets
The datasets I will be using are from Kaggle by the National Football League. There are these 3 different datasets:

Injury Record Dataset: Contains information on 105 lower-limb injuries that occurred during regular season games over two seasons on a team. 

Play List Dataset: Details about the game and play include the playerâ€™s assigned roster position, stadium type, field type, weather, play type, position for the play, and position group.

Player Track Dataset: Player level data that describes the location, orientation, speed, and direction of each player 

## Data Cleaning
Used Python for the data cleaning aspect of this project. Went through each of my 3 datasets to clean the fields and values.

Example: Combining similar values for a specific weather type for a game. Changing Outdoors to Outdoor value as well as other misspellings in the dataset.
